## Highlights

**OBE Course Manager** is a free tool for managing a course from the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) perspective, in line with the requirements of the **Board of Accreditation for Engineering and Technical Education (BAETE)** under the Washington Accord framework. It takes a course teacher through the complete OBE cycle — from writing Course Outcomes to printing signed accreditation evidence — and closes the Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) loop between semesters.

The underlying OBE implementation framework was developed at **Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology (AUST) in early 2018 by Prof. Mazharul Islam along with his team from AUST**, and has since been refined through OBE implementation across the six engineering programs of AUST, international OBE symposiums, and workshops conducted for the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh and universities across the country. This tool packages that framework into software that any faculty member can use.

**The entire application is a single, self-contained HTML file that runs in any modern browser** — no installation, no account, no server. All data stays on the user's own device, with the option of working directly on a file for cloud-backed safety.

## Key Features

- **Course setup** — course information (including cohort), Course Outcomes with Bloom's taxonomy levels (cognitive, affective, psychomotor), and a click-to-set CO–PO mapping matrix against the 12 Washington Accord Program Outcomes. A per-course **OBE Framework** selector offers **Version 2.2** (the 12 POs without indicators — the default) or **Version 3** (the updated 12-PO set with the 46 suggested **PO Indicators** (or your own set), 1a…12b; documentary, printed on the Outline and Specifications).
- **T&L Activities recommender (CQI-aware)** — a pool of 36 evidence-based teaching-learning activities, matched to each CO's Bloom's level, boosted by the previous semester's CQI recommendations and ranked down when marked ineffective; one-click adoption into the constructive-alignment table. The pool is extensible.
- **Assessment planning** — quizzes, exams, labs and projects broken into items, each tagged with a CO and maximum marks; the tagging drives all attainment calculations. **Class Performance** assessments need no questions: set a total, tick the COs, and the marks split equally across them (one CP column per course part).
- **Marks management** — spreadsheet-style entry with frozen headers, decimals and fractions (1 2/3), bulk student paste from Excel, and a CSV workflow (Empty Template → Import → Export).
- **Learning resources register** — the materials shared with students recorded as links (Type-filtered suggestions from a curated pool), CO-tagged so they flow into the topic-wise plan and print as Course Outline 17.3.
- **Sections, sub-sections & guidance** — the app is organised as Sections, each opening with a collapsed "What to do in this Section" card (concrete instructions, the traps to avoid, and a what-comes-in / what-you-do / what-comes-out diagram — never printed). Long Sections split into sub-section pill bars; the CQI Section stays one page with a sticky Jump-to bar and collapsible step cards carrying live progress statuses — an idiom shared by the per-assessment and per-CO cards, which collapse to one-line status summaries.
- **Direct measurement of COs & POs** — identical to the AUST Direct CO-PO Calculations method: per-student CO scores, % of students above the Target Pass Marks and KPI thresholds, and marks-weighted PO scores, with charts.
- **Indirect measurement** — a printable CO Exit Survey with editable item wording and custom open-ended questions, one-click **Google Form generation** (a downloadable Apps Script builds the whole survey in your account; responses import straight back), and Likert-based indirect attainment per CO and PO.
- **Combined attainment** — direct and indirect results combined with user-editable weights (default 80/20).
- **CQI tab (BAETE Criteria 3.8 & 5.4.3)** — teaching-learning and assessment narratives, a six-step CQI-loop status board, low-attainment analysis (filter weak students per CO, item-wise diagnostics, analyses w.r.t. T&L activities and assessment techniques), a stakeholder feedback register, and an Annexure H evidence checklist — all two-way linked with the Course Specifications and Course Report.
- **"Duplicate for New Semester"** — carries CQI action plans from the Course Report into the next offering's Course Specifications automatically, closing the loop.
- **Data safety** — work directly on a `.json` file with auto-save (Chrome/Edge), keep it in a cloud-synced folder, exchange it with colleagues; JSON export/import for backups and sharing.

## Documents Produced
